# Predicting Driver Positions in Formula 1 Grand Prix Using Historical Race Data

## Background

Formula 1 (F1) is one of the most competitive motorsports, where race outcomes are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including driver skill, team performance, track characteristics, weather conditions, and in-race incidents. The ability to predict the finishing positions of drivers in a race can provide valuable insights for teams, analysts, and fans. This project aims to leverage historical race data to build a predictive model for F1 race outcomes.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** that can predict the finishing position of a driver in an upcoming Formula 1 race based on historical race data. By analyzing data from past races, we aim to identify key performance indicators that contribute to race success and position determination.

## Problem Type

This is a **regression problem** where the model predicts the **finishing position** of a driver in a given race. The output will be a continuous value representing the predicted position (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

## Challenges

- **Feature Selection:** Choosing the right features that have the most significant impact on the driver's finishing position.
- **Unpredictability:** Various external factors like crashes, tire failures, or strategy changes that can lead to unexpected race outcomes.
- **Data Imbalance:** Some drivers may dominate certain seasons or races, making it harder to predict the positions of lower-ranked drivers.
- **Complexity:** Accounting for the interactions between weather conditions, race strategy, and driver skills.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the model:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average absolute error between the predicted and actual positions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual positions, highlighting large errors.
- **R-Squared (RÂ²):** Evaluates how well the model explains the variance in the driver's finishing positions.

## Expected Outcome

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likely finishing position of a driver in an upcoming Formula 1 race, based on historical race data. The model will offer insights into the key factors that influence race outcomes.
